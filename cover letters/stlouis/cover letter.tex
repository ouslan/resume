Dear Research Assistant Hiring Committee,

\bigskip % Vertical whitespace

I am writing to express my strong interest in applying for the Research Assistant position at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
I am Alejandro M. Ouslan, currently pursuing a Master’s in Statistical Mathematics at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez, with an expected graduation date of May 2026.

As a student specializing in Bayesian inference and spatial statistics, I have developed a solid foundation in advanced statistical modeling, econometrics, and data analysis.
Through my role as a Lead Developer at the Puerto Rico Planning Board, I led a team of engineers in the creation of automated systems that gathered and processed economic data
from multiple sources, including the BLS’s QCEW and U.S. Census. This experience honed my skills in Python, R, SQL, and machine learning, which I believe would be directly
applicable to your research projects at the Federal Reserve.

I am also deeply interested in macroeconomics, particularly in forecasting. Unfortunately, my current institution does not offer many opportunities to engage with macroeconomics professors,
making this position an ideal opportunity for me to learn and contribute in this field. The chance to work with the Federal Reserve would provide me exposure to macroeconomic
research.

This Research Assistant position presents an exciting opportunity for me to further my career goals of pursuing a Ph.D. in economics, while also contributing to
cutting-edge economic research at one of the most influential financial institutions globally. I am enthusiastic about the possibility of collaborating with
other RA's and applying my skills in fathering economic research.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and interests align with the needs of your team.

Sincerely,  
\vspace{20pt}  

Alejandro M. Ouslan \\
Graduate Student \\
Department of Mathematics \\
University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez
